<h1 class="text-center">Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

I am Markus Ressel, a software engineer from Germany. When I am not working on developing mobile applications for Android, I tinker with all kinds of projects, from simple shell scripts and libraries to full blown applications and services. Over the years I have gained experience in various languages like Kotlin, Python and Golang and firmly believe in the FOSS principle.

If you want to know more about me, you can read the [blog post](/blog/post/the-tech-life-of-markus-ressel) I have written.
If you don't care about me and/or are more interested in my work, have a look at the [Projects](/projects) overview or go straight to my [GitHub](https://github.com/markusressel) page.
