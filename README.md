# Markus' Blog

This repository holds all the code for my personal blog [https://blog.markusressel.de](https://blog.markusressel.de).

The site is written using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), which is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Using Nuxt.js, a fully static, single page application (SPA) is generated. Github Pages is used to host the site, and made accessible via a custom domain.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
